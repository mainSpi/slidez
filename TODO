-> add sliders for zoom and space !

-> add color picker for background !

-> add pwa func !
    pdf scripts need to be cached !

-> rotate function !

-> add some color to the page's background to solve transparency issues !

    - calculate all colors beforehand, so you dont have to wait while building the pdf - i didnt do this lol

-> README update !

-> default PDF/drawing on canvas !

-> file detection: is it a PDF? did it load correctly? was the file picker dialog window closed? !

-> auto disable service worker function (its annoying asf) !

-> add cache refresh feature ! this already exists its called cacheName !

-> better example pdf and isolate it from the scripts file !

-> image upload and concat feature
    - implement better verification strategy: only one pdf/png/jpg/jpeg is allowed, do not mix pdf with images !
