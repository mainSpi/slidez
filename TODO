-> add sliders for zoom and space !

-> add color picker for background !

-> add pwa func !
    pdf scripts need to be cached !

-> rotate function !

-> add some color to the page's background to solve transparency issues !
    - make this an option !

-> add option to use medium color as background - kinda of out of reach rn - NOT ANYMORRR ???? !!!!
    - calculate all colors beforehand, so you dont have to wait while building the pdf - i didnt do this lol

-> README update !

-> default PDF/drawing on canvas !

-> file detection: is it a PDF? did it load correctly? was the file picker dialog window closed? !

-> auto disable service worker function (its annoying asf) !

-> add cache refresh feature ! this already exists its called cacheName !

-> better example pdf and isolate it from the scripts file !

-> image upload and concat feature !
    - implement better verification strategy: only one pdf/png/jpg/jpeg is allowed, do not mix pdf with images !

-> concat all pdf's selected !
    - pdf to fileBuffer, somehow !

-> concat everything? maybe its too messy ! yeah its too messy im not doing it !

-> loading screen for file upload or something ! disabled tag for file picker and download btn ! now its better !

-> code refactor to remove promise from drawNewPdf ! will not be doing this i like it !

-> force A4 option (printing is broken) !
    - its not forcing A4 its just not changing the documents default size
